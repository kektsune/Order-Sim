Features:
- Randomly generated customer orders that the player must correctly match
- A menu displaying available food items and their prices
- Radio buttons to select the order style (dine-in, takeout, or delivery)
- Combo boxes for selecting the meal, side, and drink
- A total cost textbox where the player enters the calculated order price
- A DataGridView that records and displays order history
- A countdown timer that adds urgency to each order
- A total money counter that visually shows gains and losses per order

Note:
The user will perform their calculations off screen

IMPORTANT:
This program is only known to run in windows thus far. If you run it in macOS or Linux there's a chance it may not work.

This is the first release of Order-Sim. Bug reports and feedback are welcome via the Issues tab.
